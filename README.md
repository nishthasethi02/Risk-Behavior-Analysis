# Risk-Behavior-Analysis
Summer Training Project

📊 Overview
This project analyzes risk behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption using demographic and lifestyle data. It integrates Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning models, and Power BI dashboards to derive actionable public health insights.

🚀 Objectives
Perform data cleaning and EDA to understand behavioral patterns.
Build classification models to predict risk categories.
Visualize insights interactively using Power BI for better decision-making support.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization

Machine Learning
Scikit-learn for model building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Power BI
For interactive dashboarding and data storytelling

🔍 Key Results
Random Forest Classifier achieved the best performance for risk prediction.
Majority of individuals were found in medium smoking risk and low alcohol risk categories.
Adults (20–60 age group) showed the highest prevalence of risky behaviors.
Poor mental health, low exercise, and unhealthy diet were identified as major risk factors.

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Handling missing and inconsistent data entries.
Managing class imbalance during modeling and visualization.
Encoding multiple categorical variables effectively.
Integrating model outputs with Power BI for seamless dashboards.

📚 Learnings
Developed skills in end-to-end data pipelines, from cleaning to visualization.
Strengthened understanding of classification models and performance evaluation.
Gained proficiency in Power BI dashboard design for behavioral insights.

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data science techniques can be leveraged to understand and predict risky behaviors, supporting public health interventions and targeted awareness programs.
